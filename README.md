MRI-simulation
==============

The simulation work I am doing, the documents contains three main classes, Spins, Space, VXL. VXL extends Spins, Space, represents
a voxel in MRI. Spins are the proton spins inside the voxel, while Space is the cubic space of the voxel including the vessels insi-
de it.
